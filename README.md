EXPERIMENT 3 

AIM: to make a program with all operators 

THEORY: these are basically symbols that operate on operands. 
there are five types of operators in c++ which is also used in the codes 
1. arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/,%,++,--). these are the basic mathematical operators 
2. assigment operator(=,+=,-=,*=,/=). these are used to assign value 
3. comparision operator (==,<=,>=,!=). these are relational operators 
4. logical operator (&&,||,!). these are to combine conditional statements 
5. bitwise opertor (&,|,^,-,<<,>>). bit level operations
